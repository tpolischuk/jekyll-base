Honestly, I was extremely impressed by how easy it was to do. It literally took a few minutes to deploy a react app I had previously built, and I could view it on a globally available URL. The UI of the deploy process was clear and informative, and I was never confused as to what was happening behind the scenes while the code was building. Having deployed web applications and static websites, I was immediately aware that I will use this for many projects in the future.
