Itâ€™s a hard reality that documentation quality is directly correlated to effort. I have had a great experience using the docs to pick up React recently. The layout is clean, easy to navigate, and up to date within a very volatile front-end world. Facebook, obviously, has the resources to support this type of quality documentation. Another great example of quality documentation is the Mozilla Developer Network, which is always a great go-to sources as a references for issues regarding web standards because they are remarkably thorough and accurate.
