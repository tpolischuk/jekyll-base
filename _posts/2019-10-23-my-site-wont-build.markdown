Thank you for contacting Netlify support, I’m sorry you’re having an issue with [insert more specific information about their issue showing them that you’ve read their initial request].

My name is Trevor and I will be assisting you. 

Before we get started, can you provide me as much relevant log information that is output while you are seeing the problem? 

Have you been able to successfully deploy this application in the past?

Have there been any recent changes that you think might be affecting the build job? 

Is the code open source or are you willing to share this access with me?
