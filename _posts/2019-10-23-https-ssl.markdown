Basically, HTTPS and SSL are the base level of encryption on the web that enhances privacy and security by encrypting the data and requests we send over the internet to websites. It protects from man in the middle attacks when passing sensitive information like authentication or payments. While these are everyday examples that help users, I think it is also important to note that the internet is a truly global resource, and in other countries visiting a prohibited website could have life or death consequences. I think itâ€™s important that the internet maintains some of the loftier goals that the creators of the world wide web had in mind, such as preserving and expanding open knowledge and communication. SSL/HTTPS is a cornerstone of this implementation.
