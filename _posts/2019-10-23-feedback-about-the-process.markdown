Honestly, I found this take home assignment very reasonable. It was refreshing that it wasn’t what the rest of the industry is using, esoteric algorithm questions, timed coding tests, and other nonsense. It forces candidates to familiarize themselves with the tool and I think it was appropriately scoped to be respectful of everyone’s time.
