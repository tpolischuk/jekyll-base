I am a programmer located in Ojai. I am very interested in working for Netlify.
 
I believe my wide range of experience building software for the web and my industry experience in digital publishing, advertising, and high-traffic customer facing web applications dovetails into your needs for an experienced web engineer to build a product for clients from design to deployment. I thrive in work environments that take advantage of the most productive hours, minimize wasted time, and focus on results. I am confident in my ability to mentor junior engineers and collaborate with my colleagues to improve communication and engineering processes on the team.

The following are selected experiences that make me a uniquely qualified candidate for this position:

My responsibilities at PLOS honed my skills in a wide range of technologies including Python, Ruby, Bash, PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and configuration management of multiple Linux servers. I also work with several databases including MySQL, Postgres, and CouchDB. I have extensive experience debugging legacy systems as well as supporting web UIs across all browsers.

I overhauled the realtime metrics used in our Article Level Metrics using Apache Kafka, Python (Flask, Flask-API), and MySQL.

I oversaw the creation and maintenance of an open access journal built entirely on WordPress (currents.plos.org) and was the sole developer and designer for our recently launched research news arm (researchnews.plos.org). I also oversaw the redesign of our blogs network (blogs.plos.org) and created a high-availability multi-site WordPress installation. I worked extensively on PLOSâ€™s open source realtime metrics Ruby on Rails application (alm.plos.org).

I pride myself in clear communication in both written and verbal settings and get great satisfaction in helping customers and stakeholders to solve their problems.

My self study is currently focused on a deep dive of React and Docker.
